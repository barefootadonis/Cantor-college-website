Please ensure you complete the AI Tranparency Statement and include it in the above. Failure to do so may be construed as Academic Misconduct.

## ADVICE ON SUBMISSION

Do not include the `node_modules` folder.  This large folder can be recreated for marking via `npm install` so do ensure your `package.json` file is included.

The `website_code` folder should hold only the files **used** in your project.

Please do not re-submit the `website-images-assets` and `web-site-text-and-data`.  We don't want them back!  Returning unused files may lose you marks.
